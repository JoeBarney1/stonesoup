class RBParticleSmoother(Smoother):
    r"""
    The Rao-Blackwellized Particle Smoother (RBPS) for conditionally linear Gaussian models, following the algorithm presented in [1]_.
    The smoother combines particle filtering and Kalman smoothing to enable efficient smoothing in models with a mix of linear/nonlinear
    state components, allowing for conditionally Gaussian latent variables within a broader non-Gaussian framework.

    The RBParticleSmoother operates in two main steps:
    
    - **Forward Filtering** (Algorithm 1):
      This step is responsible for propagating particles through a non-linear process, updating each particle's weight based on 
      measurement likelihoods. Each particle represents a unique hypothesis about the latent state, and for each particle, a 
      Kalman filter is used to process the conditionally Gaussian state component. For each timestep :math:`k`, particles are 
      sequentially updated based on a measurement :math:`z_k`, and weighted according to their predicted likelihood.
    
    - **Backward Smoothing** (Algorithm 2):
      The backward smoothing pass reconstructs the full posterior distribution by leveraging information from future states.
      For each timestep :math:`k`, particles are adjusted by combining predictions with the observations of future states, 
      weighted by smoothing gains. This smoothing gain helps correct for any estimation error accumulated during the forward pass.
      The backward step works by beginning at the final index in the track, :math:`K`, and proceeding in reverse order to the start.

    The main smoothing operations are executed in the `smooth` function, which undertakes the backward recursion by iterating from 
    :math:`K` to :math:`1` and applying the following steps:

    .. math::
        
        \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} &= f(\mathbf{x}_{k-1})  \\
        P_{k|k-1} &= F_{k} P_{k-1} F_{k}^T + Q_{k}  \\
        G_k &= P_{k-1} F_{k}^T P_{k|k-1}^{-1} \\
        \mathbf{x}_{k-1}^s &= \mathbf{x}_{k-1} + G_k (\mathbf{x}_{k}^s - \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1})  \\
        P_{k-1}^s &= P_{k-1} + G_k (P_{k}^s - P_{k|k-1}) G_k^T

    where:
    - :math:`\mathbf{x}_{k|k-1}` and :math:`P_{k|k-1}` are the predicted state and covariance.
    - :math:`\mathbf{x}_{k-1}^s` and :math:`P_{k-1}^s` represent the smoothed state and covariance.

    The filter component operates by tracking the `Track` object for each particle, where the predicted and updated states are retrieved.
    During backward smoothing, the smoothing gain :math:`G_k` is applied, and the forward-passed state vectors are adjusted 
    based on the future states. This design enables the RBPS to handle high-dimensional and partially linear models with 
    reduced computational overhead, particularly where state dynamics exhibit linearity conditioned on the particle path.
