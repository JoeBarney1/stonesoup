class EnsembleUpdater(KalmanUpdater):
    r"""Ensemble Kalman Filter Updater class

    The EnKF is a hybrid of the Kalman updating scheme and the
    Monte Carlo aproach of the the particle filter.

    Deliberately structured to resemble the Vanilla Kalman Filter,
    :meth:`update` first calls :meth:`predict_measurement` function which
    proceeds by calculating the predicted measurement, innovation covariance
    and measurement cross-covariance. Note however, these are not propagated
    explicitly, they are derived from the sample covariance of the ensemble
    itself.

    Note that the EnKF equations are simpler when written in the following
    formalism. Note that h is not neccisarily a matrix, but could be a
    nonlinear measurement function.

    .. math::

        \mathbf{A}_k = \hat{X} - E(X)

        \mathbf{HA}_k = h(\hat{X} - E(X))

    The cross covariance and measurement covariance are given by:

    .. math::

        P_{xz} = \frac{1}{M-1} \mathbf{A}_k \mathbf{HA}_k^T

        P_{zz} = \frac{1}{M-1} A_k \mathbf{HA}_k^T + R

    The Kalman gain is then calculated via:

    .. math::
        K_{k} = P_{xz} P_{zz}^{-1}

    and the posterior state mean and covariance are,

    .. math::

        \mathbf{x}_{k|k} = \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k (\mathbf{z}_k - H_k
        \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1})

    This is returned as a :class:`~.EnsembleStateUpdate` object.
